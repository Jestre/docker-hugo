# docker-hugo
Based on the Dockerfile from [publysher](https://github.com/publysher/docker-hugo).

While I use this primarily with the CI functionality of [GitLab](https://www.gitlab.com) to automatically rebuild and publish to [Amazon S3](https://www.amazonaws.com) my [Hugo](https://gohugo.io) site following every push, it can just as easily be used to host a Hugo site.
